**Cloud Adoption Framework**

Not sure why people need to remember this, when the CPP cert is not for people that will be doing the moving to cloud.

    This is the area I feel I'm going to struggle in the most because this is more bUiSnEsS focused rather than technical.

# Perspectives

Please kill me now. This is going to be worth ~26% of the exam marks.

## Business

IT need aligns with buisness needs. IT investments are tied to buisness results.

## People

Supports change to move to the cloud? Staffing (people who can use/do it), training?

!!! danger "Review this"
    This makes no sense to me. I don't even know if this is correct or not.

## Governance 

tldr, make sure you're doing everything correctly, the law is being followed, budgets are being held to, everything fits in with audits.

## Platform

tldr, the perspective of SRE. Caring about the technology, how it'll be done, how it'll work.

## Security

Name on tin. Make sure things stay secure, follows things properly, auditable.

## Operations 

Making sure things don't break, and fixing things if they do break.
