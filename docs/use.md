Ways to interact with AWS.

# Console

Web point and click.

# CLI

If you hate yourself (like I do), and want to use bash scripts to do everything then use this, I guess.

# SDKs

Terraform, and other tools.

# Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic = scale. Builds the set up for you. Can save the configs of one and redeploy somewhere else. This seems like Amazon's own Terraform.

# CloudFormation

Write it as code. Uses json or ymal to make templates. This also seems like AWS's own Terraform.

    This and Beanstalk seem like the exact same thing. Both are "write infrastructure as code and this service makes it happen.
