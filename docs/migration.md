# Migration strategies

## Rehosting

Aka, "lift and shift". Pick up and move to AWS.

## Replatforming

Aka, "lift, tinker and shift". Making a few optimisations. Eg, take MySQL to RDS.

## Refactoring/re-architecting

Writing new code. Strong need to add features or peformance. The highest cost in terms of planning and effort.

## Repurchasing

Looking at dropping old software and take a new contract. Eg: old DB vendor to new vendor in AWS.

## Retaining

Applications that could be migrated, but if they don't need to be (or it doesn't make sense to) then don't.

## Retiring

Dropping the software as it's no longer needed.
